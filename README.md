MCleaner is my first Java program, it's a CLI based application which operates on files in chosen directory.
It renames and deletes files depending on their names.
I used REGEX expressions to determine if a directory contains a movie file and if so I would use my own IMDB Parser to parse 
data about the movie and then rename the directory to the: "MOVIE_NAME PRODUCTION_YEAR GENRE IMDB_RATING" schema.
It would also remove all the rubbish in the movie directory.
